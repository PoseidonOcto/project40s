Everything that needs to be done
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DEADLINE: week 11

3. Complete the user interaction data collection:
    Accurately track duration user spent on website and clicks.
    Send data to database (when pushing a new url, also push the political leaning read from csv)

4. Complete the dashboard:
    (b) Complete the graphs
        
        Graph 1 [the graph shown in hifi dashboard]:
            Date versus duration spent online
                Appliable filters / modes (buttons at bottom of graph):
                    Can narrow the graph to a specific time region  (i.e. from 3pm june 23rd to 6pm june 23rd)

                    Can filter by website                           (i.e. only show duration spent on instagram)
                            â†• (mutually exclusive)
                    Can toggle displaying as a *stacked bar chart* 
                        (three modes)
                        - Each block is a different website
                        - Each block is a different political leaning
                            (i.e. a single bar could consist of blocks with "slightly left leaning", "center", and 'extremely right leaning")
                        - The aforementioned modes, both active at the same time.

                        If a block is too small just add to 'other' block.
                            
6. Complete user surveys:
    (b) Conduct interviews (requires 1-5 done)

7. Website recommendation page:

        Review user surveys.

!!! (new item) !!!!
8. Onboarding:
    A video explaining how to use the extension (requires 1-7 done).
        Will be opened upon extension installation.
        Probably just a youtube video would be easiest.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note for meeting (deletable) (week 10)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On 4(b), we still have to do:
    Make x axis more readable (remove year unless needed?)
    Allow option aggregating time spent on all websites
    Stacked bar chart modes
    Website buttons should be named nicely 
        (i.e. CNN instead of edition.cnn.com; the actual website url could go below in small text)
    Better date input - hifi version would be best, but maybe like railway with advanced option if we can't.
    Move website filters below graph. Handle website filters scrolling off page.

On 5, we still have to do:
    Scaling needs some work
        Headings should probably be centered at least on wide screens.
        See issue with text escaping box.
    All body text should probably be in white boxes
    Text should probably not stretch so far horizontally
    Numbers should be slightly bigger
    Second level indent unnecessary

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note for meeting (deletable) (week 11)

On 1b
    Make width scale relative to font size not '%'.
        (it really stetches wide for my screen [and maybe the tutor's screen too!])
    Need cursor to change when hovering over 'click to see...'
    Truth status and Author should maybe be vertically aligned
