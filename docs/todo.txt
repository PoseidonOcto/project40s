            date spent duration on website  (number: milliseconds past epoch)
                // yes this means a seperate entry each time they flick back

    (b) Complete the graphs
        
        Graph 1 [the graph shown in hifi dashboard]:
            Date versus duration spent online
                Appliable filters / modes (buttons at bottom of graph):
                    Can narrow the graph to a specific time region  (i.e. from 3pm june 23rd to 6pm june 23rd)

                    Can filter by website                           (i.e. only show duration spent on instagram)

                    Can toggle displaying as a *stacked bar chart* 
                        (three modes)
                        - Each block is a different website
                        - Each block is a different political leaning
                            (i.e. a single bar could consist of blocks with "slightly left leaning", "center", and 'extremely right leaning")
                        - The aforementioned modes, both active at the same time.

                        If a block is too small just add to 'other' block.
